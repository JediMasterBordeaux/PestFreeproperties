            <p>
              Ants are incredibly strong, capable of lifting objects up to 50 times their own body weight, and they live
              in highly organized colonies with a clear division of labor, including roles such as workers, soldiers,
              and queens. They communicate using chemicals called pheromones, which they use to leave trails for other
              ants to follow, and there are over 12,000 species of ants found on every continent except Antarctica. Some
              ant species form mutualistic relationships with plants and other insects, providing protection in exchange
              for food, and despite their small size, ants play a crucial role in the ecosystem by aiding in soil
              aeration and decomposition.

              They are excellent hitchhikers, often spreading through luggage, clothing, and used furniture. Bed bugs
              can survive for several months without feeding, making them particularly difficult to eliminate once they

              Rodents are mammals characterized by their continuously growing incisors, which they must gnaw on to keep
              from overgrowing. They are highly adaptable creatures found on every continent except Antarctica, thriving
              in various habitats ranging from urban areas to forests and grasslands. Rodents play essential roles in
              ecosystems as both prey and predators, but they can also pose significant challenges as pests when they
              invade human dwellings, causing damage and transmitting diseases.

            <h1>Facts About Fleas</h1>

            <p>
              Fleas are small, wingless insects known for their ability to jump long distances and their role as
              external parasites on mammals and birds. They feed on the blood of their hosts, causing itching and
              discomfort, and can transmit diseases such as the plague and murine typhus. Flea infestations often begin
              with pets but can quickly spread to carpets, bedding, and furniture in a household.

              <li>
                <span className="li-header-text-2">Small Size: </span>Fleas are very small, typically measuring about
                1/12 to 1/6 inch in length, making them difficult to spot with the naked eye.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="li-header-text-2">Flattened Body: </span>Fleas have a laterally flattened body, which
                allows them to move easily through the fur of their hosts.

              <li>
                <span className="li-header-text-2">Jumping Ability: </span> Fleas are known for their powerful hind
                legs, enabling them to jump long distances relative to their size, often several inches high and far.

            <h1>Facts About Spiders</h1>

            <p>
              Spiders are arachnids, characterized by having eight legs and a body divided into two main segments: the
              cephalothorax and abdomen. They are found in nearly every habitat on Earth and play a crucial role in
              controlling insect populations. While most spiders are harmless to humans, some species, such as the black
              widow and brown recluse, have venomous bites that can pose health risks.
