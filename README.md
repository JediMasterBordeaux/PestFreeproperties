<h1>About This Project</h1> 
This project was undertaken as a revamp for a friend's local pest control business. My goal was to create a modern layout and feel with a robust homepage, dropdown menu's, an offcanvas for tablet and mobile phones, numerous images, distinct tabs showcasing various services, service areas, and a PestID section where users can learn about common pests and their proper identification and treatment. This project provided valuable practice in React.js, utilizing hooks such as useEffect, useRef, and useState. Additionally, it allowed me to gain more experience with Bootstrap and SASS.

<h1>What I learned</h1>
    <ul>
  <li>Gained more experience in using the useRef hook to ensure the user is properly navigated to the right page.</li>
<li>Utilized Bootstrap components for enhanced UI design</li>
<li>More practice with React router to ensure smooth navigation between components</li>
<li>Gained further practice and experience with react hooks such as useState and useEffect</li>
<li>Learned how to make dropdown menus, an offcanvas component, an image carousel and use hover classes for better user experience</li>
<li>Applied responsive design principles for optimal performance on various devices</li>
<li>Expanded flexbox and CSS expertise by crafting intricate layouts with multiple flex containers</li>
<li>Using SASS/SCSS to keep styles clean and organized. Each component has their own dedicated stylesheet</li>
    </ul>
